# Sims1Pkg

Sims1Pkg is a format for making compressing and extracting Sims 1 ``*.iff`` and other files easier. This format will only extract if ``metadata.json`` and ``.ts1`` are present.

It is primitive in it's design, at the moment. But, I think it's useful, overall, in bringing something modern Sims games have that the classic lacked.
